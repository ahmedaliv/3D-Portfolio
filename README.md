# 3D Portfolio

This project is a 3D portfolio created  using ThreeJS, React Three Fiber, TailwindCSS, and Framer Motion. The combination of these powerful technologies allowed me to build a fully-realized 3D world, complete with customized models and lighting, as well as intuitive camera controls.

## Technologies Used

* [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/) - A powerful 3D graphics library for rendering and animating the 3D model
* [React Three Fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) - A popular library for creating 3D graphics with ThreeJS in React
* [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A popular utility-first CSS styling framework
* [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - A library used to bring your React website to life with animations
* [React Tilt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-tilt) - A library for creating tilt animations on React components

## Features

In addition to the 3D world, I also implemented the following features:

* Contact form that allows visitors to send emails directly from the website
* Reusable and scalable code using Higher Order Components (HOCs) and other industry-standard best practices
* Responsive design optimized for all devices using Suspense and Preload to improve site performance and speed
